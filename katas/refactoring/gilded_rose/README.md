# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

A classic refactoring kata for practicing test-driven refactoring techniques.

## Available Languages

- [Kotlin](kotlin/) - Gradle project with JUnit 5
- [TypeScript](typescript/) - npm project with Jest

## About the Kata

The goal is to refactor the `GildedRose` class while keeping existing behavior intact. The code intentionally has poor design - your task is to improve it without breaking functionality.

See [GildedRoseRequirements.md](GildedRoseRequirements.md) for the full specification.

## Getting Started

Each language folder includes:
- The original unrefactored `GildedRose` code
- A starter unit test
- A golden master approval test for safe refactoring

Run the tests before and after each refactoring step to ensure behavior is preserved.
